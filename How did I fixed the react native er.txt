How did I fixed the react native error....

First of all in android folder in the gradle folder go in graddle-wrapper.properties
then...
set the distribution url to - distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-all.zip

that's it you are ready to go 
now run the command npx react-native run-android


For creating a new project - npx react-native init <name>
